  excerpt: the philosophy behind this site.
---

Æ’disk conciously rejects the conventional trends and practices of [mainstream web](/mainstreamWeb), and instead focuses on providing a relaxing environment and an honest browsing experience that encourages exploration. It achieves that with a set of hierarchical guidelines, where each supersedes the one below it: 


## modern integrity
Form follows function. The website should use the available technology to best aid the user in experiencing its contents, regardles of hardware or ability. Each page should be straightforward, free of excesive ornamentation, distractions or any other things that take away user's agency. This includes any code that that doesn't directly aid the user and exists only to benefit its creator (or a third party). 

In short: keep it simple, accessible and ethical.

## lo-fi sensibility
Embrace the familiar, make the most of it. The website should be comfortable for you, the creator. Don't shoot for perfection, instead make it so you want to come back and expand it. Build it using what you know, write about the things that make you happy. Experiment. Lean into this "handmade" quality, accept its imperfections and highlight idiosyncrasies. The end result will be so much better, if you enjoy the process.  

In short: relax and make it yours.

## digital garden
The digital garden movement focuses on a more mindful and personal approach to organizing information for publishing on the web. There are [amazing articles](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners#theory-philosophy-and-navel-gazing) (with the [earliest example](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/) dating to the 90s), that analyze and explore this idea in much more detail, but here's my quick summary:

Gardens grow things. You are the one cultivating the garden, but in the end nature will take whatever course it wants and you'll adapt. Just like real gardens, a digital garden is a constant work in progress; it's a different way of thinking about creating. Instead of focusing on a finished "product" you embrace the process, tending to the things you planted (and others that sprouted on their own) and give them time and space to grow.

Gardens provide a sense of discovery because they are both familiar and wild. You can walk straight through a garden to get where you want to be, but you can also explore it and even get lost in it. A digital garden should mimic such topology. Let pages branch out and loop back on themselves. Use hyperlinks as paths between different sections of the website. Allow for explortion, but don't force it. 

In short: let things happen organically.
