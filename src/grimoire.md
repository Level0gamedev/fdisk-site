  excerpt: tech wizardry and how to harness it.

Summoning daemons to do our bidding, making lifeless things appear alive, writing esoteric commands in hermetic languages and [tricking rocks into thinking](https://twitter.com/daisyowl/status/841802094361235456?lang=en). Yep, computers are pretty much sorcery. And this is my grimoire. 

The grimoire is a scrapbook for useful bits of code, software solutions and all kinds of tech wizardry. The entries here are something between a reference and a tutorial.
