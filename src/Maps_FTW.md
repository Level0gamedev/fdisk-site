Map is the surface you'll be playing on - it's your battlefield. It should be in a scale that makes sense with the pieces - anything close enough will do. It doesn't really matter what kind of map it is - a printed period map, a hand drawn map on a large sheet of paper, or even bunch of cut outs representing terrain on a table are all OK. What matters is that you can clearly identify terrain elements like woods, rivers, cities, etc. Using terrain to your advantage is an important part of the game.

Proper stuff about maps will go here. 

In the meantime, check out this [kriegsspiel map advice](https://kriegsspielorg.wordpress.com/maps/) - much of it applies to FTW.

## No Map? No problem!

Instead of using a large printed map, you can simply print or draw some terrain features and scatter them around the table to create the battlefield. It might not have the same aesthetic effect, but it will function the same.

Think of what might be an interesting element to include. Stuff like hills, forests, lakes or even towns are a good starting point, but don't be afraid to be creative and out there. It's your game, add what you want :)
