FKR is a tabletop RPGs movement giving priority to the fiction of the game over any rules. Players interact with the fictional world directly and rely on the impartial referee (not rules or dice rolls) to create the outcomes. While this style of play requires more trust between the participants than in traditional RPGs, it doesn't constrain the players with any systems existing outside of the game-world. 

In short, it's a style of play that allows for greater freedom during the game, as long as everyone is here to have fun and not "game" the system.
