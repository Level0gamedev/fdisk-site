FTW! is a grand scale wargame for the rest of us. Throw off the yoke of byzantine rule systems and expensive specialist wargaming equipment and focus on the fun parts of being a warlord! Make decisions. Command your armies. Outsmart, and not simply out-roll, your opponent.  

Frivolous Features:
* **Kriegspiel Aesthetic:** Designed to be played with wooden blocks on a printed map to reinforce the idea of generals commanding vast armies from afar. Wooden block forces are easy to DIY and have fog of war "built in." Also, they just looks really cool on a nice map!

* **Arcade-like simplicity:** Measure with your fingers, use the units' traits and positioning to mitigate luck and roll some dice (or don't - you can always opt to take half of dice value). Make decisions and see how they play out instead of tracking bunch of fiddly bits.

* **Scale Independent:** Each element is a force of hundreds of troops and can be represented by anything from a painted wood block, a miniature stand, or even paper print-out. As long as all players use elements with size/frontage that is "close enough", you're good to go.

* **Setting Independent:** FTW! is created with fantastical battles in mind, but can handle pretty much anything up-to musket era. If you have bunch of forces fighting one another in a relatively short range, you can use those rules pretty much straight out of the box.

* **Endlessly Customizable:** Forces are described by a die type (d4-d12) and optional traits. Make any units you want by combining existing traits or create new ones to fit your needs. The simple rules make designing special maps, scenarios and expansions a breeze. 

* **DIY Mentality:** Design your armies, draw your own maps, make your own pieces and write your own extra rules. FTW! is more like an RPG than a board game in that sense - it's a system that you can (and should!) tweak to your grand scale battle needs.



## Frivolous Origins
Ever since I discovered [fkr](/fkr) and learned about [Kriegspiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriegsspiel) I got enamoured with the aesthetic of wooden block & map wargames. There's something about it that really sparks my imagination. I can totally see some generals of yesteryear sitting around similar maps, moving similar pieces and planning their moves. I can imagine the armies marching through forests and clashing on the hills as the abstract blocks are pushed around the map. I wanted a game like that. A game that lets me loom over a map and feel like a general.

Long story short - I couldn't find a game that did that, so I decided to make one. Is it a good idea to make wargame starting with aesthetic first? Probably not. It's definitely not the traditional way  of doing game design, especially in the wargaming space. But I wanted to make such game, even if it goes against the wargaming grain... so, the Frivolous Tabletop Warfare was born. 

FTW! is not really that concerned with simulation or balance. All this detail gets lost when you're commanding hundreds of troops anyway. The rules exist to give your imaginary battles some structure, but beyond that they pretty much get out of the way.

Saying all that, the rules have a surprising amount of depth. This is  because FTW! stands on the shoulders of giants. I have poured over numerous different wargame rulesets, picked the bits I like and frankensteined them together into something I (and hopefully, you) want to play.
