> <b>heavy wizardry:</b> hacker jargon, n. Code or designs that trade on a particularly intimate knowledge or experience of a particular operating system or language or complex application interface.

Heavy Wizardry is an experimental tabletop RPG about virtual reality hackers fighting to make their realworld communities a better place. It presents itself as an in-universe zine, but works also as a standalone art book. It uses cyberpunk tropes and early computer aesthetic to highlight contemporary issues. Basically, it's a game and a thinly veiled critique of late stage capitalism.

The game is currently on backburner. It's â‰ˆ70% complete.
