Welcome to ƒdisk!

I'm [Fred](/author) and this is my loosely organized [digital garden](/digitalGardens) containing a mélange of personal projects, research, ideas and other assorted notes. 

The entries here aren't all organized, or even all complete. It's a space for me to document thoughts on the fly, tending to them and expanding them as needed, without worrying about how "public-ready" they are.

Nevertheless – you found your way to this place. That means that you'll probably find something interesting inside. So, stay around and explore!
