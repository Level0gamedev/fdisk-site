Welcome to ƒdisk!

I'm [Fred](/author) and this is my loosely organized [digital garden](/design/#digital-garden) <span style="color:var(--fg_acc);">eventually</span> containing a mélange of personal projects, research, musings and other assorted notes. 

This website isn't about any one thing in particular. It's an open thinking environment where I can store, work, share and reflect on ideas. The entries here aren't all organized, or even all complete; it's a living archive which will grow and change over time.

Nevertheless – you found your way to this place. That means that you'll probably find something interesting inside. So, stay around and explore!
