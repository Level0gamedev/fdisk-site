 <p style="text-align:center;"> * * * This is an early draft. Stuff is incomplete, messy and subject to change. * * * </p>
 
FTW! is a Kriegsspiel inspired mass battle wargame played with wooden pieces on a map. While it's designed with fantastical clashes in mind, the rules are flexible enough to handle anything up to horse-and-musket era.

* You need wooden play pieces, a map/battlefield and a set of polyhedral dice (d4-d12).

*  Each piece represents hundreds of soldiers. To differentiate units, each is painted in player's color and is labelled with a name, its class (a die type) and icons representing its traits (if any). Use the unit's class die type for all of its actions.

* An average medium infantry unit is d8 class without any traits. Units of lower class/die type are better in combat, but move slower. The opposite is true for higher class units. Traits let units bend the rules of the game.

* **Whenever you would roll, you can instead take half of the die value (e.g 5 for d10).**

* Unit traits, terrain and positioning other special rules can provide advantage to a task. Roll an extra die for each advantage and choose which result to keep.

* Setup your units on the map according to the scenario, face their labels towards you and hidden from an opponent. Alternate turns moving your units XXX

* To move a piece, roll its class die and move up to that many leagues. A default league length is equal to the width of your index and middle fingers put together. Difficult terrain costs extra lengths to travel through.

* Combat happens when units come into contact. Square up both pieces and roll their class dice including any advantages. Lower roll wins combat. A draw means that units are locked in combat until their next turn. A roll of 1 destroys the opponent outright. Remember you can always take the half of the class die instead or rolling.

* After losing combat a unit becomes disordered. Flip it so its label is facing up. It can still move and fight as normal. If a disordered unit loses combat, it gets destroyed. A disordered unit can rally instead taking an action on its turn. Flip it back so the label faces you.

* The game centers around making tactical choices to try to mitigate luck. Use the terrain and unit traits to gain advantages. Use clever positioning to deny advantages to your opponent. Use common sense and the example lists to decide if something grants an advantage. If there is no clear answer, negotiate or roll for it.

* Play proceeds until the scenario objectives are reached or one of the sides has lost more than 50% of their units. Have fun!

## Introduction

Welcome Frivolous Tabletop Warlord!

These rules let you step in the shoes of a general commanding vast armies in grand scale battles. Each piece under your control is a force of hundreds strong. Each turn represents hours in the life of your troops. At such scale it's pointless trying to track individual soldiers, exact distances and other minutia - from where you sit, the war looks very much like wooden pieces on a map.

The rules reflect that. They are purposely simple and loose to simulate the fact that you are not there on the ground, leading each battle. Your focus is on the big picture, using your smarts to mitigate luck and turn the tides in your favor. However, even best laid plans can fail, and even the most dire odds can bring unexpected results. Nothing is certain.

To simulate this, almost all actions in FTW! are based of a die roll. Even something as simple as moving from point A to point B becomes an ordeal when you need to account for hundreds of troops. Of course, you can always choose to play it safe, giving your troops an order you know they can achieve with time and manpower to spare. You do this by skipping the roll and taking half of its possible value. Choosing when to play it safe and when to risk it is just one of the many decisions you'll have to make each turn.

Because at it's core, FTW! is a game about decisions. The fun, depth and complexity comes not from following an elaborate set of rules and tracking minute details, but from making a call and seeing how it plays out. 

## What you need to play?
* **The Units:** Grab some [Wooden Blocks](/Wood_FTW). They should all be the same size (at least for rank and file troops) and easily identifiable - painting blocks single color and attaching a sticker designating unit type on one side will do the trick. The block size I'm currently using is 1x⅜x⅜ inches. A good size force is somewhere between 15-20 blocks.

* **The Battlefield:** You need a [map](/Maps_FTW) with clearly marked terrain to represent your battlefield. The maps should make sense scale-wise with the size of the wooden blocks. You'll want around 2x2 feet of playing space for the default block/force sizes, but feel free to go larger.

* **The Dice:** Lastly, grab a set of RPG dice. Die types are unit classes - a unit uses that type of die for all its rolls. When moving, you want to roll high, and when fighting you want to roll low. You only need one of each type of die, but having more will speed things up.

## Core principles

FTW! uses a 4,6,8,10 and 12 sided polyhedral dice to resolve actions. The rules use the standard RPG nomenclature of a letter *d* followed by the number of sides when referring to them. Hence, a d10 represents a ten sided die.

To perform a task, you roll the class die of the unit performing the action. Sometimes you will want to roll high (for tasks associated with speed and manoeuvring), other times - low (for tasks associated with strength and combat). 

During play certain elements (traits, narrative positioning, terrain, scenario rules, etc.) may grant you **advantages** to your task. For each advantage you roll an extra die of the same type you were already rolling. Choose one die to keep as your result and discard the rest.

For any roll in the game you can choose to **play it safe**. To do so, declare it to the table and take a result equal to half of the value of the die type you were about to roll. So, if you were to roll a d8, your safe result would be 4. Advantages do not affect the outcome when playing it safe.

The rules are left purposely simple to let you immerse yourself in the narrative of the battle and focus on making tactical decisions. This also means there might be times when you try to do something not covered by the rules. To resolve those issues simply **negotiate** with the other players and make a ruling on how to proceed... or have an impartial judge make it.

**Rulings** can include dice rolls. If it makes sense for the unit to affect the disputed outcome, just let "them" decide how it all plays out. Use your unit's class die against your opponent's. Agree if the roll should be high or low, calculate advantages or play it safe and roll for it. You just created a procedure to resolve those situation in the future. 

If **no consensus** can be reached using above methods, both players simply roll a d20 and whoever rolls higher gets to do things their way. This is the only roll where you can't play it safe. No matter how you reached the decision, when a ruling is made, write it down and use it for any future games in the campaign. 

## Your forces
Each wooden piece represents hundreds (even going into low thousands!) soldiers. Depending on the theme of your army, you may call it a battalion, regiment, horde or any other cool name you come up with - the choice is purely thematic. In the rules we call them a **unit**. 

Units are identified by a **label** with the unit's class and trait icons. The players are encouraged to include a thematic name or a small graphic to the label that adds some narrative detail and flair. It's purely optional, but adds much to the narrative of the battle. This label should be attached to one of the long sides of the block. 

**Class**, expressed with a die type (d4 to d12), is an abstraction of the unit's size, discipline, skill, equipment and bunch of other detail combined into one, easy to remember number. The smaller the die, the more lumbering the force is - it'll move around the battlefield more slowly, but it'll do better in combat. High class units are light and swift, but at the cost of battle proficiency. Whenever you need to roll for this unit, you roll using its class die.

**Traits** are a catch all category for all the ways this unit can bend the rules of the game. This is what really adds detail and differentiates units from one another. Traits will usually provide an advantage under certain circumstances (advantage when travelling in forest, advantage when charging into combat, etc.), but can also change the rules in other ways. 

All units begin the battle **In Order**. While in Order, rotate the block with the sticker facing you and hidden from the enemy. Units can become disordered by losing combat and retreating. Rotate them sticker side up to show a piece is in disorder.

**Disorder** is abstract representation of any and all negative things that can affect a unit: casualties, loss of morale, fear, getting lots - you name it. A unit in disorder can still move and fight, but it's vulnerable: if a disordered unit loses combat it gets destroyed. Disordered units can rally back to being In-Order instead of taking their action.

## Setting up
Placeholder - Choose a map/battlefield, agree on the scenario and/or objectives and gather your forces. Each player deploys units according to the chosen scenario (or simply on their side of the battlefield). When deploying, face the labels towards you. This signifies that the force is "in order" and hides the unit type from your opponent, creating a kind of fog of war.

## Taking turns
Placeholder - players alternate turns by moving one of their units at a time. A more interesting Command-and-Control solution will be added once I iron out the core gameplay. I have few ideas I want to test before I commit to anything, but I want CoC to have a decent impact on how the game is played.

## Movement
Movement in FTW! is measured in **leagues**. A league is equal to the total width of your index and middle finger put together... or around 1.25 inches. It doesn't really matter exactly how long is a league in miles or kilometers. The distance is purposely left unspecified to work on multiple map and time scales.

Roll the class die for the active unit (or simply skip the roll and take half of the die value) - this is how many **Movement Points** this unit gets this turn. It costs one point to move one league. Moving through certain terrain and other special actions can cost extra movement points. You don't have to spend all of the points each turn, but they are gone if you don't. 

**To move** a unit a length of one league, align your two fingers to the entire block's front and move it so the entire back of the block touches your other finger as shown. Units can only move in the direction they are facing, but you can align and place the unit anywhere along the length of your fingers for a bit of lateral movement.

You may **Rotate** the active unit up to 90 degrees on their turn as a part of their movement for free once. Each additional rotation costs one movement point.

Units are **unable to move through** any terrain declared as impassable or other units (enemy or friendly). They can move through a gap between elements if more than half of the unit's length can fit through it.

Instead of moving, a unit may spend its turn to **Rally**. Flip the block back into in-Order status (the label facing you) and rotate it to face any direction you want.

**Retreat** is the only move action available to units locked in combat (as they can't move or rally). This is done by turning the piece around (facing change 180 degrees) and moving it away from combat per normal movement rules.   
 
## Combat
When the front of your piece comes into direct contact with an enemy piece (even partially), those units engage in battle. Square up both units to indicate that they are **locked in combat** - they are unable to move until one side retreats or is destroyed. If a unit begins its turn locked in combat, it has to choose to either fight on (resolve combat as normal) or retreat.  

Combat can also be initiated for units facing each other less than a league away. If both players agree to attack, simply square up both units and lock them into combat. If players disagree, both roll their unit's class die and whoever rolled higher gets to get their way.

To **square up** the pieces, push them together until they are are flush with each other (as shown). This will move both pieces to "meet in the middle" as the troops rush into battle. 

Usually it doesn't matter which player is squaring up the pieces. However, in situations when both players  want to do it (e.g there is something to gain by squaring pieces a certain way), each player rolls the class die of their unit to try to outmaneuver each other. As with any roll, players can use any applicable advantages or play it safe. Higher roll gets to square up the pieces. 

**Resolve combat** immediately after the units are squared up. Each player rolls their unit's class die and an extra die for each advantage (or plays it safe and takes half the die value). No matter how many dice are rolled, each side picks only one die to keep as their result. 

**Lower roll wins the combat** and deals a hit to the opponent. A roll of 1 deals two hits. This means that if both sides roll a 1, they both deal two hits to each other (which is enough to destroy a standard unit). A draw means both sides stay locked in battle. 

A unit **receiving a hit** is put in disorder. If the unit was already in disorder, it's destroyed - remove it from the game. All hits are cumulative, so a unit in-order will get destroyed if it receives two or more hits at once. Any excess hits are wasted.
