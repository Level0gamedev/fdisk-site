FTW! is a Kriegsspiel inspired mass battle wargame played with wooden pieces on a map. While it's designed with fantastical clashes in mind, the rules are flexible enough to handle anything up to horse-and-musket era.
 
## Introduction

Welcome Frivolous Tabletop Warlord!

These rules let you command vast armies at a truly grand scale. Each piece is a force of hundreds strong and each turn represents hours in the life of your troops. At such scale it's pointless trying to track individual soldiers, exact distances and other minutia - from where you sit, the war looks very much like wooden pieces on a map.

The rules reflect that. They are purposely simple and loose to simulate the fact that you are not there on the ground, leading each battle. Your focus is on the big picture, using your smarts to mitigate luck and turn the tides in your favor. However, even best laid plans can fail, and even the most dire odds can bring unexpected results. Nothing is certain.

To simulate this, almost all actions in FTW! are based of a die roll. Even something as simple as moving from point A to point B becomes an ordeal when you need to account for hundreds of troops. Of course, you can always choose to play it safe, giving your troops an order you know they can achieve with time and manpower to spare. You do this by skipping the roll and taking half of the possible value. Choosing when to play it safe and when to risk it is just one of the many decisions you'll have to make each turn.

Because at it's core, FTW! is a game about decisions. The fun, depth and complexity comes not from following an elaborate set of rules and tracking minute details, but from making a call and seeing how it plays out. 

## What you need to play?
* **The Forces:** Grab some [Wooden Blocks](/Wood_FTW). They should all be the same size (at least for rank and file troops) and easily identifiable - painting blocks single color and attaching a sticker designating unit type on one side will do the trick. The block size I'm currently using is 1x⅜x⅜ inches. A good size force is somewhere between 15-20 blocks.

* **The Battlefield:** You need a [map](/Maps_FTW) with clearly marked terrain to represent your battlefield. The maps should make sense scale-wise with the size of the wooden blocks. You'll want at least 2x2 feet of playing space for the default block/force sizes, but feel free to go larger.

* **The Dice:** Lastly, grab a set of RPG dice. Die types represent unit class - that unit uses that type for all their rolls. When moving, you want to roll high, and when fighting you want to roll low. You only need one of each type of die, but having more will speed things up.

## Core principles

FTW! uses a 4,6,8,10 and 12 sided polyhedral dice to resolve actions. The rules use the standard RPG nomenclature of a letter *d* followed by the number of sides when referring to them. Hence, a d10 represents a ten sided die.

To perform a task, you roll the class die of the unit performing the action. Sometimes you will want to roll high (for tasks associated with speed and movement), other times - low (for tasks associated with strength and combat). 

During play certain elements (traits, terrain or scenario rules, etc.) may grant you an **advantage**. For each advantage you roll an extra die of the same type you were already rolling. Then you choose your result from the dice you rolled. No matter how many dice you roll, you will only count the result from one of them.

For any roll in the game you can choose to **play it safe**. To do so, declare it to the table and take a result equal to half of the value of the die type you were about to roll. So, if you were to roll a d8, your safe result would be 4. Advantages do not affect the outcome when playing it safe.


## Your forces
Each of your wooden pieces represents of hundreds (even going into low thousands!) soldiers. Depending on the theme of your army, you may call it a battalion, regiment, horde or any other cool name you come up with - the choice is purely thematic. In the rules we call them a **force**. 

Forces are identified by a **label** with the force's class and trait icons. The players are encouraged to include a thematic name or a small graphic to the label that will add a narrative detail and flair. It's purely optional, but adds much to the theme of the game. This label should be attached to one of the long sides of the block. 

**Class**, expressed with a die type (d4 to d12), is an abstraction of the force's size, discipline, skill, equipment and bunch of other detail combined into one, easy to remember number. The smaller the die, the more lumbering the force is - it'll move around the battlefield more slowly, but it'll be better during combat. Whenever you need to roll for this force, you roll using its class die.

**Traits** are a catch all category for all the ways this force can bend the rules of the game. This is what really adds detail and differentiates forces from one another. Traits will usually provide an advantage under certain circumstances (advantage when travelling in forest, advantage when charging into combat, etc.), but can also change the rules in other ways. 

All forces begin the battle **In Order**. While in Order, rotate the block with the sticker facing you and hidden from the enemy. Forces can become disordered by losing combat and retreating. Rotate them sticker side up to show a piece is in disorder.

**Disorder** means the troops are shaken, disorganized and probably suffered some casualties in their ranks, but still able to carry on. They can still move and fight but they are vulnerable and easier to destroy while Disordered. Forces can rally back to being In-Order later during a move.

## Setting up
Choose a map/battlefield, agree on objectives and gather your forces. Each player deploys forces on their side of the battlefield. When deploying, face the labels towards you. This signifies that the force is "in order" and hides the unit type from your opponent, creating a kind of fog of war.

## Taking turns
Placeholder - players alternate turns by moving one of their forces at a time. A more interesting Command-and-Control solution will be added once I iron out the core gameplay. I have few ideas I want to test before I commit to anything, but I want CoC to have a decent impact on how the game is played.

## Movement
Movement is measured in units
