The workshop is a place where I document any current (and the no so current) projects I work on. Its part archive, part knowledge repository. However, unlike the entries inside [the laboratory](/laboratory), the things living inside the workshop have a clear end goal… or at least a stage where I am happy to call them done (or at least 'functional').
