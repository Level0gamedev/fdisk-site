  excerpt: lo-fi duplication technology.

The term mimeograph (or just mimeo) refers both to the process as well as the machine that uses it. It originates from AB Dick's implementation of Thomas Edison's patent. In a big over-simplification it's a way of duplicating documents by pushing ink through specialy prepared [stencils](/mimeoStencils). Like screen printing, but different. 

Originally the duplicating was done by pushing the ink through a stencil to the page below by hand, one at a time. It got soon replaced with a new invention - the rotary press! Now the copies were done in seconds by simply cranking the machine and letting its do it's thing. 

The device itself is quite simple. You have a drum on which you load the ink (in a special vessel if you're fancy or on a fabric pad, if you're like me, and can only afford a cheapo machine) and cover it with the stencil. There's a rubber roller underneath the drum to grab, squeeze and move the page. Most machines have some kind of tray for paper and later models add a way to automatically feed the it under the drum.

When you turn the crank, the page is pulled between the drum and the roller. The tension makes it move at the same speed as the drum and creates a point of contact where the ink is squeezed onto the page. After the paper rolls through the stenciled part of the drum, the it simply comes out (hopefully nicely) printed on the other side of the machine. Simples.

As time progressed the machines became more and more sophisticated, eventually incorporating electric motors, automatic ink dispensing and all kinds of different bits of fancy automation. Of course this means the machines became more complex and more difficult to fix on your own. Risograph^[Risograph machines resemble standard copy machines on the outside, but they use color ink and stencils just like mimeographs. The stencils are made on the fly from the artwork using a thermal printing process that melts part of the stencil paper.] (which is having a bit of its own renaissance nowadays) is basically an example of fully automated mimeograph tech.

Because mimeograph machines were cheap and easy to use, they became a staple of schools and offices all over the world. Some devices could even be used as spirit duplicators^[Spirit duplication is a completely different process to mimeograph. It has more in common with carbon copying, but is often incorrectly called mimeograph because of the machine overlap] - simply remove the ink pad and attach a spirit master in place of a stencil and you're good to go. Such devices were a one-stop copying solutions up to the 1980s. Eventually, the mimeo's reign ended when Xerox stormed the world with their photocopier.

For me, the hand cranked mimeograph it's where it's at. Let's get printing like it's 1889!
