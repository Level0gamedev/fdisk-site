  excerpt: a mechanical mark maker.

I got into typewriters by accident. I was researching [mimeographs](/mimeograph) and thought it would be good to have a typewriter to test mimeo stencil making. One thing led to another and I was offered a [Smith-Corona Galaxie II](/galaxie_II) pretty much for the cost of shipping. By the time the machine got to me, I was already hooked.

Nowadays typewriters exist mainly as objects d'art appreciated for their aesthetic and industrial design. They are an obsolete technology, but still perfectly usable. They demand our labor and make such racket and fuss to produce artifacts that are both mechanical and handmade... and completely incompatible with our digital lives. I think this is why they appeal to me...

It's a medium tailor-made for post-digital age.
