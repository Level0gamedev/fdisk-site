## Timeline of ideas

Below is a forever-incomplete compilation of ideas that shaped roleplaying games. It's a reference to help me orient myself and connect-the-dots when thinking critically about RPG rules and experiences. The timeline is organized chronologically, but I am adding things as I research, so gaps are to be expected.

### turn of XIX/XX century 
Wargames are a thing (and probably were before, just not well preserved). Everyone knows about Wells's *Little Wars*, but  [Verdy du Vernois's Tactical War Game](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/aoQDAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) from late XIX century points to existence of even earlier rulesets. Played mostly on the floor, taking over whole rooms. Also, played by military officers (fun? training? both?)

Worthy of note: relatively simple rules (although Tactical War Game mentions earlier, complex games). Existence of arbiter - a proto-GM.

### 1970s - birth of RPG
Gary Gygax, Dave Arneson and other nerds in Wisconsin add more narrative to their wargames and create a whole new awesome hobby. Rules are kinda hand-wavy, but eventually more concrete rules are added, so it can be turned into a commercial product (and perhaps to make it easier to understand?). Other groups exist, use their own rulesets, only few end up published. D&D (+ advanced) rules. Arnesonian school gets pretty much forgotten.

Worthy of note: rulings over rules

### Early 2000s - forging narratives
Critical thinking of RPG in the open on [TheForge](http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php), GNS theory, New Wave RPGs. Beginning of the indie rpg onslaught thanks to internet, pdf and POD services.

Concept: Setting the Stakes. Thinking critically about outcomes of conflict (vs. thinking on task basis) in games like Burning Wheel or TSOY. Eventually the idea trickles down to story games, takes a more narrative shape and goes out of fashion, as it now has two (similar, but very different) meanings/uses and is confusing.
