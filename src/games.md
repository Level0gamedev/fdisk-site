I love game design. The idea that mechanical systems can not only facilitate fun, but also be used to reinforce the themes and narratives inside the *magic circle* really resonates with me. Making a game work on both those levels is a puzzle that I really enjoy doing. 

This is probably the reason why I am so bad at finishing games. Once the puzzle is solved, implementing it feels like a chore compared trying to solve a next. I am trying to be better about that, this is why inside here you'll find projects in all states of completion.
