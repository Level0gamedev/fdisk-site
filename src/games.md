I love game design. The idea that dry, mechanical systems can not only facilitate fun, but can also be constructed in a way to reinforce the themes and narratives of that fun really resonates with me. It's a puzzle I really enjoy solving. It's another thing entirely, of course, to actually implement such solution. 

This is my artsy-fartsy excuse for why I am so bad at finishing games ;)
