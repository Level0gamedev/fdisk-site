I love game design. The idea that mechanical systems can not only facilitate fun, but also be used to reinforce the themes and narratives inside the *magic circle* really resonates with me. Making a game work on both those levels is a puzzle that I really enjoy solving. It's another thing entirely to actually implement that solution. 

This is probably the reason why I am so bad at finishing games ;)
