I am still figuring all this out. Right now I am using a 3/8 inch square dowel from a hardware store cut into 1 inch long pieces. Each is painted in a player/army color and has a little label on one side with a type/name, die type and letters to signify TAGs (special traits).

Later on I am thinking of making some spiffy label sheets that you can print out and stick on your units. Maybe even army sheets for some flavor and trait listings.

More to come - including pics and DIY advice.
