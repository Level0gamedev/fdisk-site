Every now and then I find myself on a vintage boardgame kick. Occasionally I find some cool mechanics that don't seem to get much use nowadays. So, I am writing those findings down, maybe they will come in handy in the future. 

## Encounters made of multiple cards

Many adventure games use event cards. In fact it is a central mechanic in games from Talisman to Eldrich Horror. However, most of them use a single card per encounter. In [Legend of Heroes](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1351/legend-heroes) events are built from multiple cards. Each card generates a part of the story and prompts the player to pull a card from another deck (monster, threat, treasure, etc.). This adds to the randomness and discovery. The only similar thing I've seen was in [Fortune and Glory](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/95103/fortune-and-glory-cliffhanger-game), where players can choose to pull extra cards during an expedition, creating another leg of the journey. 

## Task difficulty based on player character

I like this mechanic because it's kinda [fkr](/fkr). Instead of characters having numbered statistics, different tasks are easier or harder based on who the character is. I've seen it first in [Legend of Heroes](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1351/legend-heroes), but [Dungeon!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1339/dungeon) has similar mechanic where each class is better/worse at handling different tasks. Each obstacle has uses a table with difficulty numbers and it is matched to the character "class." Sure, the same thing can be done with keywords or modifiers, but this approach opens the door to task resolution based on narrative, instead of numbers.

## Roll a die differently depending on action

I originally discovered it in [BattleBall](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6795/battleball), a fantasy American football game where each character on the team uses a different die type (D6 to D20). When moving, you want to roll high (this is how many spaces you move), when tackling you want to roll low. This makes it super simple to differentiate units' abilities at a glance and minimizes bookkeeping. It also makes so much sense that the armored heavy-hitters would be much slower than the light-footed guys and vice versa.
