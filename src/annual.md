<h1 style="margin-top:-1em;">The Annual.<span>a chronicle of annual themes and noteworthy things.</span></h1>

Inspired by fellow [merveillites](https://chotrin.tilde.institute/the_annual.html) and [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE), I am integrating annual themes into my life starting 2021. This page keeps track of my theme progress and other accomplishments per year.

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0"> 2021. <span><i>the year of preservation.</i></span></h1>

This year's theme, *preservation*, is a response to what 2020 brought. It's a reminder to take better care of myself and find ways to build a bit of a financial safety net for the future. More than that, I want to focus on preserving and documenting my projects (which means I also need to actually finish at least some of them!), and things happening in my life (via journaling). Finally it's a nudge to be more eco-conscious in my choices. 



<h1 style="margin-bottom:0"> 2020. <span> <i>the last(?) theme-less year.</i></span></h1>

I didn't choose a theme, so 2020 did it for me - the year of COVID. Truth is, the pandemic didn't hit me as bad as it did others, but it was still not a good year by any means. It was stagnant and depressing and I ended up going through bulk of it on auto-pilot.
