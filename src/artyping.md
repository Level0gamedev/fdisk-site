Eventually I want to try my hand at typewriter art, in the meantime I'm collecting inspiration and resources on the medium in this little repo:
* [Excelfie](https://luciadossin.net/excelfie.html) - a post-digital type-arting performance by Lucia Dossin.
* [James Cook](https://jamescookartwork.com/) renders landscapes and portraits using a typewriter.
* [Leslie Nichols](http://www.leslienicholsart.com/textualportraits) renders amazing "textual portraits."
* [Artyping](https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22artyping%22) - a small collection of books about proto ASCII art.
