The Print-O-Matic A2G is my first mimeo device. It's an example of a late hand-powered rotary miemograph. It was originally designed to print on the back of post cards (with main selling point was using it for mail-in advertising and making invitations), but the benefit of it in 2021 is that it's small, simple and relatively easy to find at a reasonable price.

My machine came with a Supply Kit consisting of a bottle of ink (all dried out), bottle of correction fluid (looking good), a stylus, a brush for applying ink on the drum and couple neat extras: couple never-used, pre-cut "clip-art" stencils, a plate for shading/half-toning and an original 1963 proof of purchase! There was a inked pad already on the drum (still wet with some 1960s ink, had to dispose of it) and a spare ink pad that right now I am keeping as a "template" for making more.

## How it works?
The way the device works is quite simple. An ink pad is placed on the drum. Ink is applied to the pad with a brush. Stencil is placed over the inkpad and secured to the drum. Place your paper on the tray, turn the crank, and presto! You're printing!

What's happening is that the arm attached to the drum opposite the crank pushes the paper towards the drum, where it is caught between the drum and a small rubber roller hidden underneath it. Then, as the crank is turned, the paper is pulled underneath the drum where the roller creates a point of tension. This tension squeezes the ink from the pad through the stencil and the printed page comes out on the other end!

That's the theory at least, as I haven't tested it just yet. Once I figure out how to make new [stencils](/mimeoStencils) I can start experimenting with this device and get it printing!
