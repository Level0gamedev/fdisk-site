  excerpt: "what's all this about?"

[fdisk.space](/siteColophon) is a personal website and a digital garden of [Fred Bednarski](/author). It strives to be [accessible and low-bandwidth friendly](/designPhilosophy). 


It's one part early internet style home page, one part digital playground and like five parts personal wiki; a space where I document and catalog my thoughts, projects and other interesting bits for future reference and just for fun of it. It's my own, happy sliver of cyberspace, away from the mainstream.

This website is public because I enjoy sharing knowledge and ideas, but moreso because I enjoy exploring personal sites... and if internet taught me anything, is that there are definitely others who share this (or any other) niche interest. So, I am adding one more personal site to the mix for other curious internauts to discover.
