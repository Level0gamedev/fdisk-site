  excerpt: what is this all about?

[fdisk.space](/) is a personal website and a digital garden of [Fred Bednarski](/author). 


It's a static website written in markup and generated with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). It doesn't use cookies, JavaScript or any other type of external conent and  requires only few kilobytes of handwritten css to run. It strives to be accessible and low-bandwith friendly. 

It's one part early internet style home page, one part digital playground and like five parts wiki; it's a personal space where I document and catalog my thoughts, projects and other interesting bits for future reference and just for fun of it. It's my own, happy sliver of cyberspace, away from the mainstream.

This website is public because I enjoy sharing knowledge and ideas, but moreso because I enjoy exploring personal sites... and if interenet taught me anything, is that there are definately others who share this (or any other) niche interest. So, I am adding one more personal site to the mix for other curious internauts to discover. 

ƒdisk is inspired by personal websites of Merveilles community members, and would not exist without the help and inspiration of [Clemens Scott](https://nchrs.xyz/) and [Thomasorus](https://thomasorus.com).
