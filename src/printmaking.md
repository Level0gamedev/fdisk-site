  excerpt: printing unplugged.
---

Recently I became fascinated with printing/duplicating without need for electricity. I haven't done much printmaking in the past (I mean, I did squeegee some ink through a screen, but this was more of a "try anything at least once while in college" kind of affair), so currently this is my research repository into some alternative printing methods.

Proper art projects will (hopefully) follow.
