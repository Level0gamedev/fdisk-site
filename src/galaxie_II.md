The **Smith-Corona Galaxie II** is my first typewriter. It's a popular 196X machine sporting a lovely mid-century design with a dash of googie on the faceplate. This faceplate and the inclusion of a single changeable type key (red 1/!) are the only differences between this and previous model... well, that and the gimmicky "jeweled escapement".^[The jewel in the escapement is said to be a synthetic ruby or sapphire, but who can say for sure with 60s marketing. [Issue 114 of ETC Magazine](https://etconline.org/backissues/ETC114.pdf) did a deep dive into the history and usefulness of that little jewel, and is worth a read]  

My Galaxie comes with a grey metal body, black platen and off-white keyboard. It uses the standard Pica typeface. With some trial and error, I have removed and reattached the body to give it a deep clean. The only remaining issue is the broken right plastic carriage release lever, which I plan to replace or 3D print eventually.^[A broken carriage release lever is a common sight on this style of Smith-Corona typewriters. The plastic becomes more bristle with age and snaps easily. Fortunately, there's already a 3D printable replacement on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4505915)]

The machine has been cleaned throughout and is now working beautifully right down to the bell. I am getting better at using it, as typewriters require a bit more oomph compared to typing on computer keyboards. Typing on it is a pleasant acoustic and tactile experience. 

The Galaxie is currently using a brand new universal black/red INKVO ribbon (2 inch spools and Â½ inch tape) for some of that classic rubrication feel.

The instructions manual can be downloaded from [xavier.edu typewriter manual repo](https://site.xavier.edu/polt/typewriters/tw-manuals.html).

Photos to come.
