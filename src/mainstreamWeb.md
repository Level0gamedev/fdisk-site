Somehow we accept that websites just run code we didn't ask for, to tell companies we do not want to hear from, about who we are and what what we do. Then it's faceless companies all the way down, selling this info to one another just so I can block an add for sunglasses that some algorithm along the way decided are just *perfect* for me. 

I mean, this must greatly profit everybody involved. Because that website I visited to read a 500 word article is happy to spend money to also serve me: two dozens of images, a video playing in the background, embeded social media content and sliding windows with extra CONTENT all over the page until my laptop begs for help and puts the fan into high gear.

Thanks, I hate it.

...and I don't even want to start about the front and back-end webdesign. I will one day, but not today. However, if you need more "old man yells at THE CLOUD" content in your life, especially from someone much smarter than me, I can recommend checking [Hunted by Data](https://idlewords.com/talks/haunted_by_data.htm) and especially [The Website Obesity Crisis](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm).
