It seems that over the decades I have played (or at least seen) more games than I can remember. Every now and then something will remind me of one of those games I've forgotten. I will have this fuzzy, half-formed memory that will bother me until I find it. 

The worst of it is when I find a forgotten game, then forget it again after some time. It happened more than once. So, I am writing them down now: here are the games I have forgotten. They are not all good games, but they at least have some memorable parts that got etched in my brain.

## [Blinky's Scarry School (C64, 1990)](https://www.mobygames.com/game/blinkys-scary-school)
**spark memory:** trying to beat it with a guide from a magazine.

## [Pool Champion (PC, 1995)](https://www.old-games.com/download/4831/pool-champion)
**spark memory:** drunk uncle wants to play pool

For some reason this game was on my 166Mhz Pentium PC when I bought it - it's a pool simulator with a story. I vividly remember that you start at a house party, go downstairs to escape the noise and there is an old dude there, swinging a bottle of beer and talking to you. Not sure exactly what he says because I didn't know English very well then. I think he is your uncle. Oh, and also there's a pool table there too. So you play pool.

...and somehow this starts this whole story where you travel from place to place, bar to bar and play pool for money. I think the goal was to get to Las Vegas for some tournament. I remember being really into the "realistic" graphics and how big the game felt. I mostly enjoyed the graphics, and what I could understand from the plot, my dad was the one who really got into it. 

## [Capsule (PC, 2014)](https://www.mobygames.com/game/capsule)
**spark memory:** lonely space rover minimalism

I've stumbled upon this game randomly on steam one day, and I am yet to play it, but the art style really caught my attention. You are piloting a kind of space rover using a radar interface. It all feels very old tech, reminding me of space-age computers of late 60s up to early 80s. Sure, it's just a texture with few shaders and super low-rez pixel art, but this minimalist presentation really appeals to me. Will need to actually play it one of those days. 

## [Help the Hero (Web/Flash)](https://www.kongregate.com/games/armorgames/help-the-hero)
**spark memory:** diablo style inventory puzzler.

In this flash game you are a hireling for a "standard issue" tongue-in-cheek fantasy hero. The most memorable part of the game is definitely the core mechanic of organizing equipment into a grid (diablo style).  The game takes this idea and turns it into a type of "timed" puzzle game, where you need to be quick about what and where you keep stuff. It also has a pretty cool, cartoony (and very flash-era) artstyle.

As it is a flash game, and flash is going away it might be a better idea to use something like  [Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/) or just grab the .swf file and run it locally.

## [Captain Blood, (C64, 1988)](https://www.mobygames.com/game/captain-blood)
**spark memory:** you're a space skeleton - press a button, explode a planet.

## [Weird Dreams (PC, 1989)](https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/weird-dreams)
**spark memory:** surrealist side scrolling in your pajamas.

## [Rad Mobile (Arcade, 1991)](https://www.mobygames.com/game/rad-mobile)
**spark memory:** barriers made of stacked sprites.

## [Budokan (PC, 1989)](https://www.mobygames.com/game/budokan-the-martial-spirit)
**spark memory:** california games, but martial arts.

## [Heretic Kingdoms: Inquisition (PC, 2004)](https://www.mobygames.com/game/heretic-kingdoms-the-inquisition)
**spark memory:** rpg with bad controls where you give zombie a hand.

## [Sink or Swim (Amiga, 1993)](https://www.mobygames.com/game/sink-or-swim)
**spark memory:** platformer where you save lemming-like passangers of a ship.

## [Trickstyle (PC, 1999)](https://www.mobygames.com/game/trickstyle)
**spark memory:** hoverboard Tony Hawk.

## [Tribal Rage (PC, 1998)](https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/tribal-rage)
**spark memory:** post apocalyptic RTS with exploding pigs.

## [1213 (PC, early 2000s?)](http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/1213/)
**spark memory:** Another World, but you're a patient with powers escaping a grey facility.

## [Fuel (PC, 2010s)](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Fuel)
**spark memory:** Lonely low-rez astronaut running out of fuel
