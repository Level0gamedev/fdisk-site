I got my first computer when I was 4 and haven't stopped dabbling with tech since. Along the way I picked-up some programming skills, flirted with the hacker/maker movement and and generally kept exploring various rabbit holes of the digital world. Nowadays I am less interested in the cutting edge of computing, and more with the simple and/or vintage inspired stuff.
