My awesome wife found the recipe for this saucy pasta somewhere in the depths of the internet, and over time we tweaked it enough to call it ours. Most of the flavor comes from the roasted peppers, so you want to make sure to get some good ones - deep red in color and pretty sizable

This dish is a bit on the heavy side, so we reserve it for lazy days. Our "ritual" is to make it on Friday and enjoy it while catching up on TV shows and just generally being lazy before the weekend proper.

This recipe will make four portions. You can keep leftovers in the fridge for few days and it reheats quite well either on the stove or even in the microwave.

## Ingridients:

* 1 pack of linguine (16oz)
* 3 sizable red peppers
* 1 onion
* 4 gloves of garlic
* 1½ cups soy milk
* 4 Tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1½ Tbsp cornstarch 
* 2-3 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 pinch red pepper flake/crushed red pepper
* salt/pepper to taste

## Instructions:

Cook pasta according to the packaging and set aside.

Roast the peppers in an oven at 500F(260C) for 25min. Remove the stems, seeds & any overly charred bits. Best way to do it is to use tongs when the peppers are still hot. You can cut off the peppers near the stems and use the tongs to remove the seeds. 

Sauté the onion and garlic in olive oil until golden brown and soft – about 4-5 minutes. Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir. Remove from heat and set aside.

In a blender combine the roasted peppers, sautéd onions, soy milk, red pepper flakes, nutritional yeast and cornstarch. Blend until smooth, taste and season to taste with more salt/pepper and crushed red pepper flakes for extra heat.

Place the blended sauce in a skillet over medium heat to thicken it. Once it reaches a simmer, reduce heat to low and continue simmering until it is nice and thick. Stir in the noodles to cover them in sauce. 

Serve with (generous amounts of) [vegan parmesan](https://grimgrains.com/site/quick_sunflower_seed_parmesan.html), red pepper flakes, or freshly chopped parsley.

Enjoy!
