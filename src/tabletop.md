Board games, RPGs, wargames? Been there, rolled the dice. In fact, I got into tabletop games soon after [digital ones](/digital) and never really stopped. Over time I found that I enjoy light, but thematic games much more than a set of rules I can master. It's more about the experience than winning. 

So, this is the kind of stuff in here -  designs and musing on rules-lite & thematic games.
