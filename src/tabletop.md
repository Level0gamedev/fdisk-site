  excerpt: "physical games, physical tables!"

I used to follow the boardgame/RPG world much closer in the past, but as my tastes matured (or maybe I just got old?), I stopped carrying about the "new hotness" and got much pickier about my tabletop experiences. Nowadays I prefer thematic games with tight rules. When I play, I want to be able to immerse myself in the story and explore the game's world, not fight the mechanical systems. The rules should reinforce the narrative or at least get out of the way. 

This is the kind of stuff you'll find inside here -  designs and musing on rules-lite thematic games.
